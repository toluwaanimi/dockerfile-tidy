# Dockerfile Tidy

Dockerfile Tidy is a VS Code extension that automatically formats Dockerfiles for better readability and consistency.

## Features

- **Auto Formatting on Save**: Automatically formats your Dockerfile with consistent indentation and alignment.
- **Instruction Formatting**: Ensures Dockerfile instructions are capitalized, properly indents multi-line instructions, and preserves comments.
- **Key-Value Pair Alignment**: Aligns `ENV`, `ARG`, and `LABEL` instructions for readability.
- **Command Integration**: Runs automatically on save but can also be triggered manually.

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
3. Search for "Dockerfile Tidy" and click "Install".

## Usage

Simply open a Dockerfile in VSCode, make your changes, and save (`Ctrl+S` or `Cmd+S`). Dockerfile Tidy will format the file automatically.
